## Goals
- This is my practice for software architecture and project developement in Julia.
- learn OpenGL and Shader Language

## Use
The files: 
- `start.jl`
- `compile.jl`
- `test.jl`
  
do what you expect them to do, just run them using the terminal.

## To-Do
- work out healthy `module` architecture
- work out how to test code
- multiple window support with common backend
- run tests of my dependencies when testing my app
